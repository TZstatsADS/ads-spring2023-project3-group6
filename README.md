+ Project summary: In this project, we created 3 models to classify the images. The baseline model is the logistic regression model, which yields a relatvely low accuracy of around 24%. The Model I uses CNN(convolutional neural network) and has a better accuracy of about 40%. The Model II uses neural network based method to clean the noisy labels and then applys same method of Model I. It has a better perfomance of reaching accuracy around 50%.
